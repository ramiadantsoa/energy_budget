\section{Zenith angle and time of sunrise}
We use the same equation as in \citet{Campbell2012} to model zenith angle ($\psi$) as a function of the time of the day $t$ and latitude $\phi$.
We have
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:psi}
\cos(\psi) = \sin(\phi) \sin(\delta) + \cos(\phi) \cos(\delta) \cos[15 (t- t_0)],
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ represents solar declination which varies between 23.45$^\circ$ and  -23.45$^\circ$ between summer and winter solstice, respectively ($\delta$ is given by equation 11.2 in \citet{Campbell2012} and only depends of the day of the year).
The time of solar noon ($t_0$) and varies with longitude but since we are interested in latitudinal variation, we fix $t_0 = 12$.

At any given latitude $\phi$ and day of the year, the time of sunrise ($t_{rise}$) is the solution of \cref{eq:trise} in the time interval $[0,12]$ when $\psi = 0$
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:trise}
t_{rise} =  \frac{1}{15} \left( t_0 +  \arccos \left[ \frac{\cos(\psi) - \sin(\phi) \sin(\delta)}{\cos(\phi) \cos(\delta)} \right] \right).
\end{equation}

\section{Geometric property of the body}
For simplicity we assume that the individual is shaped as a the half of sphere (\cref{fig:geo}, such approximation can be valid for insects like beetles).
Considering a sphere is practical as we only have one free variable:  the radius $r$.

The volume of half a sphere is $V = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3$ and the surface $A = \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r^ 2 = 3 \pi r^2$ (the first and the second term of the summation represents  respectively the surface at the bottom and the cap).
We assume that the thorax occupies half of the body with volume $V_{th} = V/2$ and surface $A_{th} = \pi r^2 + \pi r^2 = 2 \pi r^2$ (the second term is half of the cap whereas the first is the same as the surface of the bottom just folded upward).

Knowing body mass $z$ and density $d$, we can convert mass into volume $ V = z/d$.
The radius is then $r = \left( \frac{3V}{2 \pi} \right)^{1/3}$.

\section{Derivation of  mathematical conditions for optimal body mass}
In this section, we derive sufficient conditions where net energy gain peaks at intermediate body mass if foraging time is limited.
Because we do not consider warm-up time, $\tau_w $ is 0 and  will be omitted in the formulas.
We defined net energy gain by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:main}
	E_n(z, \tau_f) = E_g(z,\tau_f) - E_d(z, \tau_f).
\end{equation}
The energetic gain is
\[
	E_g(z,\tau_f) = \tau_f e_g(z),
\]
with
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eg}
	e_g(z) = a_3 z^{b_3} \times \rho  = g(z) \times \rho.
\end{equation}
%
The energetic cost is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ed}
	E_d(z, \tau_f) = \int_0^{t_i} e_b(z, t) dt + \int_{t_i}^{t_i + \tau_f } e_a(z,t) dt + \int_{t_i+\tau_f}^{24} e_b(z, t) dt
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eb}
	e_b(z, t) = a_1 z^{b_1} e^{-E/[k (T_b(t)+ 273.15)]} =  a_1 z^{b_1} \theta_1
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ea}
	e_a(z,t) = a_2 z^{b_2}  e^{-E/[k (\max(T_w(z_{th}), T_e(t))+ 273.15)]} =  a_2 z^{b_2} \theta_2.
\end{equation}

We assume that temperature is constant during the day so that $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ do not depend on time.
We want to derive a relationship where \cref{eq:main} becomes a non-monotonic function of body mass $z$.
Two conditions are  necessary: net energy gain should be positive and the derivative of the net energy gain should change sign from positive to negative.
By definition,
\begin{flalign*}
	E_n(z,\tau_f) & = e_g(z) \times \tau_f  - \left( e_a(z) \times \tau_f + e_b(z) \times (24 - \tau_f ) \right) \\
			&  = \rho a_3 z^{b_3} \times \tau_f  - \left( a_2 z^{b_2}  \theta_2 \times \tau_f +  a_1 z^{b_1} \theta_1 \times ( 24 -\tau_f) \right)
\end{flalign*}
After simple algebraic manipulation, $E_n$ is positive if and only if
\begin{equation}\label[ineq]{ineq:1}
	\rho > c_1 z^ {b_1 - b_3}  \tfrac{24 - \tau_f}{\tau_f}  + c_2  z^ {b_2 - b_3},
\end{equation}
where $c_1 = \dfrac{a_1}{a_3} \theta_1$ and $c_2 = \dfrac{a_2}{a_3} \theta_2$.
%
For the second condition, the derivative is
\begin{flalign*}
	\frac{d}{dz} E_n(z,\tau_f) & = \rho a_3  b_3 z^{b_3 - 1} \times \tau_f  - \left( a_2 b_2 z^{b_2 -1 }  \theta_2 \times \tau_f +  a_1  b_1 z^{b_1- 1} \theta_1 \times ( 24 -\tau_f) \right),
\end{flalign*}
and is negative if and only if
\begin{equation}\label[ineq]{ineq:2}
	\rho < c'_1 z^ {b_1 - b_3}  \tfrac{24 - \tau_f}{\tau_f}  + c'_2  z^ {b_2 - b_3},
\end{equation}
where $c'_1 = \dfrac{a_1 b_1}{a_3 b_3} \theta_1$ and $c'_2 = \dfrac{a_2 b_2}{a_3 b_3} \theta_2$.
Thus a non-monotonic net energy gain occurs only if
\begin{equation}\label[ineq]{ineq:3}
  c_1 z^ {b_1 - b_3}  \tfrac{24 - \tau_f}{\tau_f}  + c_2  z^ {b_2 - b_3} < \rho < c'_1 z^ {b_1 - b_3}  \tfrac{24 - \tau_f}{\tau_f}  + c'_2  z^ {b_2 - b_3}
 \end{equation}

The difference between the first and last term are only in the coefficients $(c_1, c_2)$ and $(c'_1, c'_2)$.
Thus a necessary condition for \cref{ineq:2} given \cref{ineq:1} are
\begin{equation}\label[ineq]{ineq:cond}
	c'_1 > c_1  \textnormal{ or } c'_2 > c_2.
\end{equation}
In fact, we have  $c'_1 = \dfrac{ b_1}{ b_3} c_1$ and $c'_2 = \dfrac{ b_2}{ b_3} c_2$.
Thus \cref{ineq:3} is true if $b_3 < b_1$ or $b_3 < b_2$ is true.
If we assume that the exponents for active metabolic and resting metabolic rate are equal $b_2 = b_1$ and thus the condition mean that the exponent of foraging rate is smaller than the exponent of metabolic rate.
In addition,  the resource quality $\rho$ should also lie within a certain range.
We illustrate these analytical results with \cref{fig:ana}

\section{Sensitivity analyses}
The section shows results from Fig. 3a and Fig. 5 from the main manuscript are generally robust to parameter changes.
We varied independently the parameters that controls convection ($K_2$) (\crefp{fig:min}a--c), conductance $K_1$ (\crefp{fig:min}d--f), and intensity of solar radiation $r_3$ (\cref{fig:min}g--i).
The only qualitative difference is for endotherms when conductance is too high (thick line \crefp{fig:min}f), most of the heat generated endogenously dissipates in the environment leading to minor difference between small and large individuals.

We also relaxed the effect of constant temperature during the day (\crefp{fig:therm}).
The x-axis shows the initial temperature at sunrise (coldest) then increases linearly until it peaks at the middle of the afternoon (midpoint between noon and sunset). The hottest temperature is defined by an increase of $10 ^{\circ}\rm{C}$ from the temperature at sunrise.
Varying in environmental temperature does not change the qualitative results (\crefp{fig:therm} vs. fig. 5 in the main text).
For all the figures, the remaining parameters are the same as in the main text.
