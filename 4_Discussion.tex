There is a myriad of factors that influence the fitness an individual.
When large do better than small and vice versa.
Our work here is to explore the role of physiological, ecological, and behavioral processes in shaping the performance of an individual given its body size in a given environment.
the model we have developed aims to quantify the relative importance of each of those processes.
Body size and temperature are the main variables
This works, our main focuses especially on two main things: the foraging i.e. how much resource an individual can acquire and the warm-up process i.e. when foraging can happen or not.


For the first thing, the exponent of the foraging rate plays a central role in determining performance across body size.
We have found that if the exponent is lower than the exponent for the metabolic cost.
This results is somehow intuitive but we actually do not know where in parameter space are we.
Some data on dung beetles showed that, it is directly proportional.
Yet it has not been consistently tested.
In study such as Nagy, the foraging rate is inferred from metabolic cost.
In some parameter space, we actually found that only large can persist. 
This is when foraging rate is high and active metabolic rate is extremely high.
A high value of active metabolic rate has been reported for insect with b3. 
The metabolic scope is the ratio between basal rate and maximum rate but yet, that it can be with respect to a2 or b2.
This difference can create different patterns.

 The story is however more complicated than just foraging rate.
 Two external variables have significant role.
 First,  resource availability constrains the performance of large individual.
 That is rather obvious as the cost is higher.
 Second, the quality of resources gave a non-trivial results
 Intermediate body size is favored only under restricted conditions. 
 That is b3 is small and resource quality is within a certain value.
 If it is too low, there is not enough energetic gain, whereas if it is too high, the large are now penalized enough.
 There range is indeed higher when it is warm that when it is cold. 
 This is because of the weight that is put into it is multiplicative. 
 That is if theta is large, the difference between theta and theta times something is broader than when theta is small.
 These two are independent of body size. 
 The response can thus include resource availability and quality instead of focusing on endogenous processes.
 Porter already raised the issue when about shade availability (Kearney2009 pnas).
 Although not the same thing, identifying other key variables is crucial.

The second unique feature of the model is the inclusion of warm-up rate.
Behavioral thermoregulation is crucial for cold-blooded animals such as insect (refs.).
We have studied condition where active foraging can start.
The argument is based on surface-area-to-body size ratio.
Many aligns with intuition. 
Large > small endotherm have better capability because they lose less heat.
Conversely, small is better because it can absorb more heat.
Low conductance can limit the ability such that large can only forage at high temperature which is in line with intuitive explanation.
With default the parameters we used, species can complete warm-up regardless of temperature under free convection.
Large needs higher temperature due to surface-area-to-body ratio. 
Small is not optimal due to the effect of conduction which increase with s-a-t-b-r (refs).
For endotherm, the story is in line with intuitive in terms with intuitive explanation.
Large does better. 

The intuition is however untrue for when there is wind. 
The relationship becomes non-monotonic. 
The most important aspect is however is time.
Whereas activation is the first barrier time is a more important thing.
For dung beetles, the ability to be at source is crucial as resource are depleted fast.
In general, small individual warms up faster as long as they can warm-up. 
Conductance seems to play a significant role and showed a mixed strategy for endotherm.
A balance between endogenous heat production and solar absorption. 
Dilemma whether increase or decreases conductance.

The behavior has been studied in the past, for bees, moth and beetles (refs).
the theory we provided here helps to see how things change with body size and the environment.
An open question is whether these constraint can dictate the diel activity of species.
The model is rather simple but one key question is whether they can optimize their warm-up , in terms of warm-up time, but also physical property that is conductance.
Conductance for mammals is different (Bakken), and assume here it is independent of body size.
This has not be investigated in the literature.

Energy budget model are everywhere and are becoming more and more elaborated.
One example is NicheMapper which also includes DEB by Koojiman.
Our model is a very close relative and use the same principle.
They model cannot function without detailed parameters.
The role of our model is to generate assumptions, verify intuition. 
There are other models that search for performance. 
Brown for mammals but in addition to unclear.
Kozlowski (AmNat) used production rate to explain allometric exponents by optimizing.
They miss temperature.  
The model is aimed to seek a balance between theory and data.
Especially so that each parameter have a meaning and can be measured.
We do that to build the niche 


What are we missing.
It is a first approximation. 
Two main components that are missing to translate to performance.
First is conversion to offspring (i.e. fecundity).
Second is mortality.
We omitted them at the moment as we put our focus on physiology and limit the number of free parameters.
Also assimilation which can be temperature dependent.
and growth.
Power law valid?
Income-breeding insects.

The role of quantitative models to a larger scale.
Most theoretical is to explain distribution, instead of focus on that, we can use the model to explore one of the most famous relationship with body size: Bergmann's rule (interspecific).
We take here Bergmann's rule as pattern with considering the process that underlies it.
Due to the prevailing pattern that is metabolism, and surface-area-to-body but it is incomplete.
We found that these are important but cannot be evaluated with considering resource (quantity and quality).
This model has tested 3 out of 4 hypotheses.
There are two balancing forces: if warm-up is not possible then small or large can be absent at cold.
The other explanation is the absence of large in warm environment can be due to physiological limitation, or also resource limitation.
It is not however uncommon, especially for insects to show the inverse relationship.
for instance large foraging rate or dominance in competition can help them to exclude.

 Bergmann's rule for ecotherm and endotherm.?
 This work can be used for instance to generate a framework that test when B-R shall be found or not.
 
 The last thing is the role of such type of models for other theoretical works.
 In most quantitative model, r and K are not dependent on the traits.
 Such model can help to derive the actual carrying capacity or fecundity.
 This are a mechanistic explanation for other patterns...
 Performance and U-shape pattern-trade-off- shifts, whatever.

In this work we focus on understanding the role of physiological and behavioral processes in shaping the fundamental thermal niche of a species given its body size.

Mathematical models are very useful in showing the role of various processes in generating empirical patterns.
These models lay on a continuum from pure abstract to highly realistic.
In the latter, the purpose is often to mimic in great detail a particular phenomenon and the model requires intense parametrization.
Energy budget model has received great attention in explain natural phenomenon.
Energy budget model use a common currency, energy, to model phenomenon from molecular scale to ecosystem (Nisbet)
The cost however it is that it is not generalizable.
Our approach here lies closer to the abstract type of modeling.
We explore how performance, net energy gain, may depend on body size, temperature, and resource quantity and quality. 
In a different perspective, how the dependences on body size and temperature shapes thermal performance.
How variation in the coefficient and exponent would affect the observed pattern.
Given everything else is equal, what do we get....

- General thing about our approach
Looking at the big picture, our model focuses on adult income-breeding insect.
Insect has been neglected with those energy budget model relative to more charismatic species.
The reason is for clarity and transparency of the model as we can easily quantify energetic gain.
In addition, we avoid the growth process.
Although growth is important and even used as a proxy for fitness.
The performance as an adult will eventually determine the true performance.
We can look at the model such that we fix adult body size and find which one does best. 

Net energy gain as performance, how to get to fitness.
Obviously, many components are missing.
Humidity, fecundity and survival.
Large dung beetles tolerates heat, more energy reserve, more competitive.
Optimality can shift if we include mortality (e.g. kooijiman).
Our point is that this is starting point and including all those processes can be overwhelming and there is not much empirical support.

Additional applications.
Mathematical models of trait evolution, our model can be a basis to derive optimum body size along temperature gradient, derive carrying capacity as a function of trait value. 
More generally, we can look at generalized fitness landscape.
TRADE-OFFS ARE NOT ASSUMED, ARISES FROM MODEL STRUCTURE

Clear results: large body will decline first. 
We can quantitatively estimated the decrease in performance as function of the changes in the environment  (temperature and resource).
Past mass extinction, large goes first.
Effect of temperature, and pay closer attention to resource quantity and quality.

But it does not scale how it changes with body size and temperature, metabolic scope can be cause by difference in coefficient or exponent.
Our main conclusion however is that the functional form of the energetic cost is only relevant when related to energetic gain, i.e. how the exponents of the various power laws.  

How can we deviate from power law? 
Sigmoid, hump-shaped...
Another approach is to use active metabolic rate to model foraging rate.
It is also an additional assumption and shrink the breadth of possible patterns.

A particular feature of the model is to study in depth the warm-up ability of the insects.
Our model puts under the same framework endothermic and ecothermic insects.
As we simplify energy budget model, so did we with heat exchange between the individual and environment.
The model is based on Campbell for ectotherms and Bartholomew for endotherms.
Thus, rather than having realistic model, we search for pattern yet keep key variables such as surface area-to-volume ratio, solar radiation, and the role of convection.

We are trying to answer patterns of activity for insects.
Diel activity is partitioned so that large can only forage later during day because they are limited by warm-up (refs).
For dung beetles, warm-up ability can potentially explain the divide where large individual are more active forager and small individual pitch and wait (refs).
This can be due to two things.

First, whether warm-up cannot be completed when you are small.
Our model showed that there is a difference in minimum temperature for warm-up. 
It is most likely not limiting, especially in warm environment.
Moreover, for ectotherm, being small supposedly confers advantage due to higher surface area-to-body ratio. 
This is not always true when convection plays an important role and can indeed limit the warm-up ability of different body size.

Second, whether the duration of warm-up matters.
We found that it is more a penalty for large body.
The larger you are the longer it would take to warm-up.
In highly competitive community like dung beetles, an hour delay due to warm-up would greatly reduce the amount of resource available. 

Another explanation is competition.

An assumption we make is that conductance, which drives most of the pattern does not depend on body size.
For mammals, fur and skin thickness can vary with body size (Bakken1976?).
What is the situation with insects, does coloration also matters?
Can insects optimize the timing of warm-up?

Until now we reported that many relationships are not measured empirically.
Model can guide what should be measured (in our model, each parameter has a clear meaning that `can' be measured).
On another hand, we can still explore the consequence of these assumptions even if it is not empirically supported (by lack of data, not because it is wrong).

When we put all these components together, we found that thermal performance is upper bounded because physiological needs outweighs the energetic supply.
This often put large individuals into troubles especially when resources are limiting.
It makes sense, large needs more.
The lower limit is set by behavior in cold environment.
Here, large needs more time and if we subtract that from the total foraging time,  there will be a decrease in performance as it gets colder.
Small surprisingly are not much affected as warm-up time is not affected much.

The niche when conditions are more extreme at both thermal ends generate a U-shaped pattern that has been reported empirically (refs).
A central question we ask is how  niche as a function of temperature varies with body size.
We found that multiple scenarios are possible.
It all depends on what we fed the model with in terms of modeling assumptions and model parameters.
Unless resources are unlimited, net energy gain will eventually decrease with body size as temperature increases.

There are two surprising results.
First, for fixed foraging time (even without warm-up) it is quite unlikely that net energy gain peaks at intermediate body size.
Why does it depend on resource quality (I don't have a clear intuitive explanation at the moment)?
Second, the role of conductance differs at different time of the day for endotherm.
Can we measure that?  

Looking at the big picture, our model focuses on adult income-breeding insect.
Insect has been neglected with those energy budget model relative to more charismatic species.
The reason is for clarity and transparency of the model as we can easily quantify energetic gain.
In addition, we avoid the growth process.

Large dung beetles tolerates heat, more energy reserve, more competitive.
Optimality can shift if we include mortality (e.g. kooijiman).
Our point is that this is starting point and including all those processes can be overwhelming and there is not much empirical support.

Body size is our central focus here.
Explanatory power of body size.
Most measured traits and correlates with physiological functions.
Physical shape is governed by the law of thermodynamics.
This is a reference, given that the assumptions are true, one can then search for missing mechanisms if body size is not the main driver.

Bergmann's rule and pattern of body size.
We simultaneously explore 3 out of 4 mechanisms explaining body size.
Thermoregulation, physiological constraint, resource availability (what is missing is seasonality).
Without behavior, large always perform better in cold environment.
Resource availability is the most obvious as energetic demand increases with temperature.

Additional applications.
Mathematical models of trait evolution, our model can be a basis to derive optimum body size along temperature gradient, derive carrying capacity as a function of trait value. 
More generally, we can look at generalized fitness landscape.
