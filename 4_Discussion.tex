General model
Complexity for parameterization

Body size and temperature

Endotherm and nocturnal.


Behavior: Warm-up, timing of dial and seasonal activity (supported by Kearney)
Limited or increased foraging time. 

Importance of foraging.
Resource availabilty. 
Kearney vegetation cover.

Non linearity in evolutionary model

Influence of fluctuating temperature

Missing:
humidity
conversion to offspring
mortality
