\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item The model is used to explore the role of different factors in shaping the niche: behavior, physiology, temperature, and resource density.
This more to explore the magnitude of change in the parameters not about their actual values. 
This is theory for God sake.
Some results are intuitive but the model allows to quantify the effect of the parameters.
\item Importance of including multiple factors. 
Realistic but tractable model.
\item Talk about missing empirical estimates, e.g., for $b_2$ and $b_3$ and the need to study more foraging, resource abundance and quality.
\item The role of warm-up (possibility and duration) in defining niche. 
Empirical estimates of conductance, does it vary with body size? 
Warm-up and literature about diel activity.  
Endothermic insects.
\item Is body size appropriate?
\item Other weaknesses: humidity, survival, no competition = this is still a fundamental niche. We did not optimize the model. 
\item The use of energy as a proxy for fitness. 
How to convert energy to fitness?
\item Message for practical application: body size as predictor: will large suffer most?
