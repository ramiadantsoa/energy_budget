Dear Editor,

I am submitting a manuscript entitled ``Net energy gain as a function of body mass and temperature" for your consideration for publication in The American Naturalist.

A perpetual feedback between theoretical and empirical works is a crucial path for the progress of scientific knowledge.
To understand how species perform in a thermal environment, we develop a model that strives to find a balance between technical details and general insight.
The model construction and parameters are transparent yet flexible to account for additional developments and  assumptions.

Temperature is an important abiotic factor, and with global warming, understanding how species respond to temperature becomes a pressing question.
The model uses energy as a main currency and integrates and investigates the role of metabolism, foraging, and thermoregulation in shaping the performance a function of temperature and body size.
The model validates some intuitive notions on species performance but also generated new testable hypotheses.
Our work shows that evaluating thermal performance across body size requires the integration of multiple processes: physiology, ecology, and thermodynamics, and thus foster multidisciplinary works.

The authors thank L.\ Burghardt, K.\ Niitep\~{o}ld, and E.\ Swanson for comments on the earlier versions of this article, and the Theory for Life group at the University of Minnesota for discussions.

As editors we suggest, Alice A. Winn, Michael Kearney, or Pryianga Amarasekare.
This manuscript describes original work and is not under consideration by any other journal.
All authors have approved the manuscript and this submission.
We believe that this work fits the scope of the journal and hope that you would consider it fit for review.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

% Understanding how an individual or population responds to different thermal regime is a crucial question in evolution, ecology, and in conservation.
% This work investigates the role of body mass in determining how the thermal performance of an adult insect, namely whether thermal performance breadth broadens, shrinks, or shifts when body mass increases.
% We built a model which uses net energy gain--the difference between energetic gain and cost--as a proxy for performance and explored how the interplay among physiological process (metabolic cost), ecological process (foraging), and thermodynamic process (thermoregulation) shapes the daily energy budget.
% The model aims to find a balance between theory and data and thus is based on well-defined and measurable parameters but also generates general insight.
%
% We found there is no single relationship on how thermal performance changes with body mass and identified various crucial processes that drive various qualitative results.
% In general, the exponent of the scaling of the foraging rate and the amount of resource available determine the upper limit of the thermal performance whereas the ability to complete warm-up determines the lower limit.
% To our knowledge this is the first model that not only investigates how warm-up process depends on body mass but also integrates the warm-up process in evaluating the performance of an individual.
% We also highlighted parameters that requires further empirical investigation.
% On one hand, the scaling of foraging rate seems to be as important as metabolic but unlike the latter has not been consistently measured.
% On the other hand, more attention should be paid for thermoregulation process for instance the conductance parameter which modulates heat exchange the body and the environment.

%Can I talk about the future? The model is a starting point for more elaborate worksâ€¦ can be framework for future work such as look for optimal body %size, evolution (and of species range)
