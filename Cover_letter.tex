Dear Editor-in-Chief, \newline
I am submitting a manuscript entitled ``Net energy gain as a function of body mass and temperature" for your consideration for publication in The American Naturalist.

Understanding how an individual or population responds to different thermal regime is a crucial question in evolution, ecology, and in conservation.
This work investigates the role of body mass in determining how the thermal performance of an adult insect, namely whether thermal performance breadth broadens, shrinks, or shifts when body mass increases.
We built a model which uses net energy gain--the difference between energetic gain and cost--as a proxy for performance and explored how the interplay among physiological process (metabolic cost), ecological process (foraging), and thermodynamic process (thermoregulation) shapes the daily energy budget.
The model aims to find a balance between theory and data and thus is based on well-defined and measurable parameters but also generates general insight.

We found there is no single relationship on how thermal performance changes with body mass and identified various crucial processes that drive various qualitative results.
In general, the exponent of the scaling of the foraging rate and the amount of resource available determine the upper limit of the thermal performance whereas the ability to complete warm-up determines the lower limit.
To our knowledge this is the first model that not only investigates how warm-up process depends on body mass but also integrates the warm-up process in evaluating the performance of an individual.
We also highlighted parameters that requires further empirical investigation.
On one hand, the scaling of foraging rate seems to be as important as metabolic but unlike the latter has not been consistently measured.
On the other hand, more attention should be paid for thermoregulation process for instance the conductance parameter which modulates heat exchange the body and the environment.

%Can I talk about the future? The model is a starting point for more elaborate worksâ€¦ can be framework for future work such as look for optimal body %size, evolution (and of species range)

This manuscript describes original work and is not under consideration by any other journal.
All authors have approved the manuscript and this submission.
We believe that this work fits the scope of the journal and hope that you would consider it fit for review.
We look forward to hearing from you.
