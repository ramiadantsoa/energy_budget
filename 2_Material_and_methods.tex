\section*{Material and methods}
The model investigates the daily performance of an adult insect with deterministic body size and is suited to compare body sizes within monophyletic group.
We define performance as net energy gain which is the difference between energetic gain and cost.
The energetic gain is the amount energy acquired  during foraging whereas  the energetic cost is the sum of metabolic cost while resting and during activity (i.e., foraging).
The model contains thermoregulation phase that precedes activity.
The completion of warm-up is necessary because muscles are only operational when they are at certain temperature. 
First, we describe the external environment.
Second, we use empirically derived relationship to model rate of energetic costs and gain as a function of body size and temperature.
Third, we use thermodynamical principle to describe changes in body temperature during warm-up.
Finally, we stitched these components altogether to define net energy gain. 

\subsection*{Environment}
We consider three properties of the environment: the environmental temperature, the intensity of solar radiation, and the amount of available resource.
We define environmental temperature $T_e$ as the temperature felt by the individual while inactive.
We implicitly assume that environmental temperature takes into account other factors such as humidity and so on.
Because insects are small enough, we further assume that environmental temperature does not depend on body size.
For simplicity, we assume temperature is constant during the day.

We model solar radiation as in \citet{Campbell2012}.
The intensity of solar radiation at any given time of the day is \[S_R = S_0 \cos(\psi) \]
where $\psi$ is the zenith angle and $S_0 = 1361 \mbox{W.m}^{-2}$ the maximum solar radiation at noon.
%Time of sunrise and sunset (when $|\psi| = 90^{\circ}$)
Solar radiation is needed to generate heat during the warm-up component of the model (see appendix for more details on how $\psi$ depends on latitude and the day of the year as well as how we obtained the time of sunrise).

Finally, we assume that during the day, a fixed quantity of resource $R$ is available.
$\rho$ represents the energy density per unit of resource mass. %when the cost of processing the food, egestion, and excretion are subtracted. 
Poor environment in term of resource can thus be obtained by low quantity $R$ or low quality $\rho$.

\subsection*{Energetic cost}
\subsubsection*{Cost: resting metabolic rate}
Following \citet{Brown2004}, we assume that resting metabolic rate increases with body size and with temperature such that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eb}
	e_b(z, t) = a_1 z^{b_1} e^{-E/[k (T_b(t)+ 273.15)]}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is body mass, $T_b(t)$ is the body temperature, at time $t$ in Celsius, $E$ and $k$ are respectively the activation energy and the Boltzman constant (this is the Arrhenius equation), $a_1$ is and $b_1$ are some constants which will be called respectively coefficient and exponent.
In \cref{eq:eb} $b_1$ is often suggested to be around 0.75 \citep{Kleiber1947, Peters1986, Brown2004}, which we use as a default value in our analyses.
At rest, the body temperature of the individual matches that of the environmental \citep[e.g.,][]{Bartholomew1978} so that $T_b$ in \cref{eq:eb} can be replaced by $T_e(t)$.

\subsubsection*{Cost: active metabolic rate}
During activity, an individual expends more energy than rest. 
For simplicity, we assume the active metabolic rate has the same functional form as that of the resting metabolic rate, thus
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ea}
	e_a(z,t) = a_2 z^{b_2}  e^{-E/[k (\max(T_w(z_{th}), T_e(t))+ 273.15)]}
\end{equation}
where $T_w$ is the minimum thoracic temperature that would permit foraging.
Warm-up phase (see section Warm-up below) will determine whether an individual will be able to warm-up and eventually forages.
Large bodied often have higher temperature during activity \citep{Bartholomew1977a}.
For simplicity, we use a linear relationship \citep{Bartholomew1977a}, i.e.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Tw}
	T_w(z_{th}) = c_0+ c_1 z_{th}.
\end{equation}
$z_{th}$ is the mass of the thorax and $c_0$ and $c_1$ two free parameters.
Thus, unlike resting metabolic rate, the temperature effect depends on body size.
The effect of temperature is the same as in \cref{eq:eb} except the use of the function $max$.
This is a rough approximation such that when the environmental temperature is too high, there is an additional cost of foraging---say the additional energy used to avoid overheating. 
The cost of foraging is naturally higher than cost of resting and is expressed by higher value of $a_2$, $b_2$, and stronger effect of temperature.

\subsection*{Gain: foraging}
We define foraging rate $g(z)$ as the average amount of resource and individual collects per unit of time.
We are interested in cases where foraging rate increases with body size and for simplicity, we assume a power law 
\[
	g(z) = a_3 z^{b_3}.
\]
This equation pools together different form of activities such as searching time, handling time.
We will not assume any particular value for $b_3$ and in fact the interest is on how $b_3$ influence 
For instance, small individual are more agile leading to a concave shape or if large individual have better search ability (e.g. to find resource that are further) leading to a convex (\cref{fig1}). 
%T: Do we need to discuss that it does not depend on temperature? I would say no. The reason is that temperature is already included in the metabolic cost of activity. It would be redundant to have it here. In addition, we don't have any empirical evidence to model that.  
Finally, the rate of energy gain is  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eg}
	e_g(z) = a_3 z^{b_3} \times \rho  = g(z) \times \rho.
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Warm-up}
Warm-up is a prerequisite for foraging when the temperature of the muscle is below its minimum value which occurs when the environmental temperature is low. 
However, they don't need to warm-up the entire body but essential the thorax where most of the muscles are. 
Here, we track the temperature of the thorax $T_w$ (\cref{eq:Tw}), i.e. with respect to thoracic mass rather than the body mass.

The most common strategy for warming up is to absorb solar radiation.
Heat is transfered to the thorax from the surface of the body by passive conductance \citep{Bakken1976}.
A second strategy is to endogenously generate heat by contracting muscle against each other similar to shivering \citep[e.g.,][]{Kammer1974}.
We assume that frequency of contraction increases linearly with thoracic temperature $f[T_{th}]  = a_w T_{th}$ for $T_{th}> 0$ and 0 otherwise.
With a slight abuse of terminology, we call the first one ectotherm and the second one endotherm. % T: this can be a bit confusing 
The distinction between ectotherm and endotherm is obtained by setting $a_w$ to zero.

A coupled differential equations  tracks changes in the thoracic temperature and rest-of-the-body.%T: find a better term instead of the rest of the body
Geometrically and for simplicity we  assume that the insect/individual is shaped as an half a sphere, the thorax constitutes the interior of first half of the sphere.
The surface of the thorax and the rest-of-the-body can be easily calculated given the mass and the density of the insect (see appendix).
We only compare warm-up within group.

Change in thoracic temperature $T_{th}$ is 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dTh}
	\frac{dT_{th}}{dt} = \frac{1}{s z_{th}} (z_{th} e f[T_{th}] +  A_{th} K_1(T_r - T_{th}))
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the specific heat capacity, $e$ is the calories generated per contraction and per gram of muscle \citep{Kammer1974}, $A_{th}$ is total surface of the thorax, and $K_1$ the conductance between the thorax and the rest-of-the-body.

The exchange between the rest-of-the-body and the environment is based on thermodynamic process. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dTr} 
	%\begin{split}
		\frac{dT_{r}}{dt} =  \frac{1}{s z_{r}} \Bigl( - A_{th} K_1(T_r - T_{th})  \Bigr)
			+ \frac{1}{s z_{r}} \Bigl( A_r \left[ - c_p K_2 h(T_r -T_e, V)- \sigma \varepsilon T_r^4 + \sigma \varepsilon T_e^4  + r_3 S_R  \right] \Bigr),
%\end{split}
\end{equation}
We consider two forms of convection here where $ h(T_r -T_e, V) = (T_r- T_e)^{1.25} (1/V)^{1/12 }$ for free convection (no wind) and $ h(T_r -T_e, V) =  1.4 \times 0.135 \sqrt{u/V^{1/3}} (T_r- T_e) $ for laminar convection \citep{Campbell2012}.

$K_1$ is defined above, $c_p$ is specific capacity of the air. 
$K_2$ is a constant controlling convection between the body and the air \citep{Campbell2012}.
$\varepsilon = 0.935$  is the emissivity of gray body.
$u$ is wind speed.
$V$ is the volume of the insect and $A_r$ is the surface area of the rest-of-the-body (it is simply the surface of the whole body).

The last term of \cref{eq:dTr}  is an approximation of more the detailed equation in \citet{Campbell2012}.
Here, we ignore view factors, reflected radiation and so on, and pool every source of radiation in $ \sigma \varepsilon T_e^4$ and $S_R$. 
Parameters $r_3$ is used to scale and summarize the quantity of absorbed solar radiation.

We solve the ODE numerically using NDSolve implemented in \citet{Mathematica10}.
The solution that depicts the change in thoracic temperature  ($T_{th}(t)$) is analyzed to see if the minimum temperature  required for activity $T_w$ is reached.
In that case, we can also solve the duration of the warm-up $\tau_w$ which corresponds by definition to $T_{th}(\tau_w) = T_w$. 

 \subsection*{Net energy budget}
We now stitched all the components above to calculate  the energy budget during a 24-hour period.
Daily activity consist of resting, warming up and foraging (activity).
We assume continuous activity here, thus requires only one warm-up phase.
We start the calculation at sunrise $t = 0$.
Total foraging time can be fixed $\tau_f$ or as a function of resource availability $R$. 
In the latter case, $\tau_f = R/g(z)$.
If warm-up cannot be completed, foraging does not occur and thus $\tau_f = 0$.
If warm-up can be complete, we subtract the duration of warm-up $\tau_w$ from the total foraging time $\tau_f$. 
The total daily energetic gain is given by
\[
	E_g(z,\tau_f - \tau_w) = (\tau_f - \tau_w) e_g(z).
\]
%
If we assume that warm-up starts at $t_w$ (we use $t$ to denote the time of the day and $\tau$ for duration), then the total daily  energetic cost is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:et}
	E_t(z, \tau_f) = \int_0^{t_i} e_b(z, t) dt + \int_{t_i + \tau_w}^{t_i + \tau_f } e_a(z,t) dt + \int_{t_i+\tau_f}^{24} e_b(z, t) dt 
\end{equation}
$e_b$ is defined in \cref{eq:eb}  and $e_a$ in \cref{eq:ea}.
The energetic cost for endothermic insect is negligible \citep{Heinrich1975} and is omitted in \cref{eq:et}.

Daily net energy gain is obtained from the  difference between energy gain from foraging and total energy expended, i.e.,
\[ 
	E_n(z, \tau_f) = E_g(z,\tau_f) - E_t(z, \tau_f).
\]

\subsection*{Power law and parameter justifications}
The central assumption here is that relationship between body size and that metabolic and between body size and foraging rate are represented by a power law.

A general pattern is that resting metabolic rate scales with body size with an exponent 0.75 \citep{Kleiber1947, Peters1986, Brown2004}.
Such value has been reported from unicellular organisms to mammals \citep{Brown2004}.
Although there is a debate about the actual values \citep[e.g.,][]{Isaac2010}, we adopt that value to diminish the number of free parameters rather explore the other exponents which are not established.

The power law relationship for active metabolic rate has less empirical ground.
Since many very few studies have spanned the measurement for a range of body size that look specifically to active metabolic rate.
A notable example is a work by \citet{Bartholomew1978} who found a power law with exponent $b_2 = 1.17$.
In general, what is known is specific values of the metabolic scope which is the ratio between maximum active metabolic and resting metabolic rate.
Several studies have reported that oxygen consumption can be as high as 70 times than resting although a typical values is about 40 \citep{Bartholomew1981}.  
In our model, metabolic scope can then be adjusted either by varying $a_2$  or by $b_2$ whether it is mass independent or not. 

Recent studies have explored rate of energetic gain and recovered a power law relationship \citep{Maino2015, Pawar2012}.
There seems to be no single exponent $b_3$.
For instance, its value can depend on dimension of the search space with a value of 0.85 for a two-dimensional search space to 1.06 in three-dimensional search space \citep{Pawar2012}.
Body size can actually influence other processes, for instance walking speed  can scale with a power 0.29 \citep{Peters1986}, with dominance competition excerted by larger individual, exponent might also scale superlinearly.
Our goal however is not to use argue about the homogeneity of these values but instead to explore the consequences of their heterogeneities.
\cref{fig1} depicts how the exponent influences the shape of the power law.

Another form that can be used to model the effect of temperature is the use of $Q_{10}$ which is the change in rate with a $10^ {\circ} \rm{C}$ increase in the body temperature \citep{Precht1973}.
We however opted for the Arhenius equation by \citet{Brown2004} because it reduces the number of free parameter but also it approximates the temperature effect for $Q_{10} = 2.45$.  
Finally, to  insure that the coefficients are not different, the model is best for species with narrow taxonomical scope and thus restricted to monophyletic group including within species. 

\cref{table1} summarize different parameter values we used and explored in this work.
