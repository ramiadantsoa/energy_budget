    In each panel, dashed, thin, and thick lines depict different foraging rate exponents ($b_3 = 0.5,\ 0.8,\ \text{and } 1.25$, respectively).
    ``Standard'' extrinsic parameter values are 
    resource quantity $R = 500$ (defined only when the resource amount is fixed; panels a,b,e,f),
    resource quality $\rho = 12$,
    foraging time $\tau_f = 45 \text{ min}$ (defined only when foraging time is fixed; panels c,d,g,h), 
    and environmental temperature $T_e = 15^\circ C$.
    Intrinsic parameter values for active metabolic rate are $a_2 = 20 a_1 \text{ and } b_2 = 0.75$ for ``standard'' (panels a--d), and $a_2 = 30 a_1 \text{ and } b_2  = 1.25$ for ``higher'' (panels e--h).
    Additional parameter values and measurement units are provided in \cref{table:table1}.
