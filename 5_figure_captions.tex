	Solid lines mean the first component have a direct link on the second component.
	Dashed and double-headed lines represent a correlation or indirect link between the two components.

	Different scenarios when net energy gain peaks at intermediate body size.
	The upper panels show the influence of resource availability.
	The lower panels show the influence of temperature when resources are unlimited.
	Low resource = 2.5 g, intermediate resource = 20 g, unlimited resource means an individual can collect 50 times its body mass, $b_2 = 0.75, a_2 = 20 a_1$, and $T_e = 15 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$.
	Low, intermediate, and high temperature = $5, 15, 25 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$.
	We assumed a high active metabolic rate $a_2 = 40 a_1, b_2  = 1.25$.
	Fixed parameter values: $b_1 = 0.75, \rho = 16$.
	Without warm-up.

	a) Daily net energy gain  $E_n$ as a function of body mass $z$ for different value of foraging exponent $b_3 = 0.5, 0.8, 1.25$, dashed, thin, thick lines respectively  at $T_e  = 15 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$.
	b) $E_n$ is maximized at an intermediate value of $z$  when shaded regions and resource quality $\rho$ intersect (i.e., \cref{eq:C1} is satisfied).
	Warm ($35^{\circ} \rm{C}$) and cold (15$^{\circ} \rm{C}$) environmental temperatures are denoted by red and cyan, respectively.
	The upper (lower) limit of the shaded region is $\widetilde{dE_n}$ ($\widetilde{E_n}$).

	Remaining parameters are in \cref{table:table1}.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	To focus on the effect of solar radiation, daily temperature is constant.
	Solar radiation increases linearly from 0 to 0.25 of the maximum value $S_0$ during a period of 6 hours.

	b) shows the effect of the exponent $b_3$  for large $z= 2$ (thick) and small $z = 0.5$ (thin) body sizes, $\tau_f = 1$,.

	Solid (dashed) lines represent abundant (scarce) resource $R = 30, (15)$).
	Reduction in resource availability does not affect the much smaller individual so that solid and dashed lines overlap ($b_3 = b_2 = b_1 = 0.75$).
