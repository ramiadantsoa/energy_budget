    % E: For a figure to have multiple panels, the panels need to relate to one another.  Could (a) include, say, notes on the lines that depict power laws?
    Model components.
    (a) Unidirectional solid lines show one component affecting another.
    Bidirectional dashed lines show a correlation or indirect link between the two components.
    % E: Please also explain the different shapes used in (a), e.g., non-rhomboid parallelograms for environmental variables.
    (b) Power law functions of body size, $z$, are used throughout the model.
    The expression $z^b$ is concave when $0 < b < 1$ and convex when $b > 1$.
    % E: The caption and figure weren't agreeing before.  I changed in one way.  Please check!

    Scenarios whereby net energy gain does or does not peak at intermediate body size.
    In each panel, dashed, thin, and thick lines depict different foraging rate exponents ($b_3 = 0.5,\ 0.8,\ \text{and } 1.25$, respectively).
    ``Standard'' extrinsic parameter values are 
    resource quantity $R = 500$ (defined only when the resource amount is fixed; panels a,b,e,f),
    resource quality $\rho = 12$,
    foraging time $\tau_f = 45 \text{ min}$ (defined only when foraging time is fixed; panels c,d,g,h), 
    and environmental temperature $T_e = 15^\circ C$.
    Intrinsic parameter values for active metabolic rate are $a_2 = 20 a_1 \text{ and } b_2 = 0.75$ for ``standard'' (panels a--d), and $a_2 = 30 a_1 \text{ and } b_2  = 1.25$ for ``higher'' (panels e--h).
    Additional parameter values and measurement units are provided in \cref{table:table1}.

	a) Lowest temperature required for the completion of warm-up as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	To show how solar radiation can limit warm-up, solar radiation at 30 degree latitude during equinox is scaled with a factor 0.25.
  Thick, thin, and dashed lines represent endotherms with laminar convection, ectotherms  with laminar convection, and ectotherms with free convection.
  Convection factor $K_2 = 0.1 \times$ the default value.
  b) Duration of warm-up for endotherms (thick lines) and ectotherms (dashed lines) as a function of body mass and temperature.
  In the scenario, solar radiation is not scaled and $K_2$ takes default values.
  Remaining parameters: wind speed  $u = 1$, $a_w = 1.25$.
	% Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 0.05 \, c_p, r_3 = 0.5$.
