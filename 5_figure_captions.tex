	A caricature of how the exponent influences the concavity (convexity) of the power in the power law relationship.
	The black and gray lines represent foraging and active metabolic rates.
	The exponent of the metabolic rate is a bit lower to visualize to assure that the gain is more than the cost most of the time.

	The upper panels depict different resource availabilities at $15 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$. 
	Low resource = 2.5, intermediate resource= 20, unlimited resource means an individual can collect 50 times its body mass, $b_2 = 0.75, a_2 = 20 a_1$. 
	The lower panels depict the influence of temperature when resources are unlimited and high active metabolic rate $a_2 = 40 a_1, b_2  = 1.25$.
	Low, mild, and high temperature = $5, 15, 25^{\circ} \rm{C}$.

	Warm ($35^{\circ} \rm{C}$) and cold (15$^{\circ} \rm{C}$) environmental temperatures are denoted by red and cyan, respectively.
	The upper (lower) limit of the shade region is $\widetilde{dE_n}$ ($\widetilde{E_n}$).

	Lowest temperature required for the completion of warm-up as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	The thorax is half of the total body mass.
	To focus on the effect of solar radiation, daily temperature is constant.
	Solar radiation increases linearly from 0 to 0.25 of the maximum value $S_0$ during a period of 6 hours. 
	a) conductance is low (0.1 $\times$ the default value).
	b) conductance is default, wind speed  = 0.1m/s.
	c) For endotherm with free convection $a_w = 1.25$. 
	Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 0.05 c_p, r_3 = 0.5$.
	Remaining parameters are in table 1.

	Duration of warm-up as a function of the timing of warm-up.
	Daily temperature varies from $15^{\circ}\rm{C}$ at sunrise and peaks at $30^{\circ}\rm{C}$ in the middle of the afternoon.
	Solar radiation is equivalent to what would happen at 30 degree latitude during to equinox clear sky.

	Shape of the fundamental niche as a function of temperature.
	Except in d),  temperature is constant during the day.
	a) The simplest case without warm-up, high resource availability (30 gram).
	b) Halving resource availability and without warm-up.
	c) Adding warm-up and  restoring resource availability to high, there is a penalty for long warm-up time as it reduces total foraging time, no change in temperature.
	d) A complete  scenario with warm-up and variable temperature that increases from 15 to $30^{\circ} \rm{C}$ from sunrise to mid-afternoon.
