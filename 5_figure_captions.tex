	Lowest temperature required for the completion of warm-up as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	To focus on the effect of solar radiation, daily temperature is constant.
	Solar radiation increases linearly from 0 to 0.25 of maximum value for 6 hours. 
	a) conductance is low (0.1 default value), b) conductance is default, wind speed  = 0.1m/s, c) for endotherm $a_w = 1.25$. 
	
	Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 1, r_3 = 0.5  $
