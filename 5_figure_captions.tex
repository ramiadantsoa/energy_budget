	a)  $E_n$ is maximized at intermediate value of $z$  when shaded regions and resource quality $\varepsilon$ intersect (i.e., \cref{C1} is satisfied).
	Warm (35 $^{\circ} \rm{C}$) and cold (15 $^{\circ} \rm{C}$) environmental temperatures are denoted by red and cyan, respectively.
	The upper (lower) limit of the shade region is $\widetilde{dE_n}$ ($\widetilde{E_n}$).  
	b) Various shapes of $E_n$ based on a).
	Foraging time $t_f = 1$ hour.

	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	To focus on the effect of solar radiation, daily temperature is constant.

	Duration of warm-up as a function of the timing of warm-up.
	Daily temperature varies from $15 ^{\circ}\rm{C}$ at sunrise  and peaks at $30 ^{\circ}\rm{C}$ at the middle of the afternoon.
	In a) and b), thickest, thick, thin, and dashed lines denote  $z = 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01$,  respectively.
	In c), thick, thin, and dashed gray lines denote high ($\times 10$), medium ($\times 1$), and low ($\times 0.1$) conductance between the rest-of-the-body and the thorax.

	Shape of the niche as a function of temperature.

	a) The simplest case without warm-up, high resource availability (30 gram).
	b) Halving resource availability and without warm-up.
	c) Adding warm-up and  restoring resource availability to high.
	d) The most realistic scenario with warm-up, and variable temperature  which increases from 15 to 30 $^{\circ} \rm{C}$ from sunrise to mid afternoon.
