	A visualization of the concavity (convexity) of the power law relationship.
	The black and gray lines represent foraging rate (gain) and  metabolic rate (cost) .
	The coefficient of the metabolic rate is halved so that gain exceeds the cost.

      Daily net energy gain  $E_n$ as function body mass $z$ without warm-up.
	The upper panels shows the influence of resource availability.
	Low resource = 2.5 g, intermediate resource = 20 g, unlimited resource means an individual can collect 50 times its body mass, $b_2 = 0.75, a_2 = 20 a_1$, and $T_e = 15 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$. 
	The lower panels show the influence of temperature when resources are unlimited.
	Low, intermediate, and high temperature = $5, 15, 25 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$.
	We assumed a high active metabolic rate $a_2 = 40 a_1, b_2  = 1.25$.
	Fixed parameter values: $b_1 = 0.75, \rho = 16$.

	Lowest temperature required for the completion of warm-up as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	To focus on the effect of solar radiation, daily temperature is constant.
	Solar radiation increases linearly from 0 to 0.25 of the maximum value $S_0$ during a period of 6 hours. 
	a)  low value for conductance (0.1 $\times$ the default value).
	b) default value conductance, wind speed  = 0.1m/s.

	Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 0.05 \, c_p, r_3 = 0.5$.
	Remaining parameters are in table 1.

	Solid (dashed) lines represent abundant (scarce) resource resource $R = 30, (15)$).
	Reduction in resource availability does not affect the much smaller individual so that solid and dashed lines overlap ($b_3 = b_2 = b_1 = 0.75$).
