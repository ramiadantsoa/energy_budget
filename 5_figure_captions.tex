\caption{
	A visualization of the concavity or convexity of the power law relationships.
	The black and gray lines represent foraging rate (gain) and  metabolic rate (cost).
	The coefficient of the metabolic rate is halved so that gain exceeds cost.
}

% E: I'm not sure what the final sentence of the caption means in this regard.
% T: it is a visualization so I did not use the actual values just z^b. If I did not half the coefficient of b_2, the gray line will be somewhere between the thick and dashed.
% E: So you mean the exponent of active metabolic rate is half that of foraging rate?  I still think rephrasing would help.

\caption{
      Daily net energy gain  $E_n$ as a function of body mass $z$ without warm-up.
	The upper panels show the influence of resource availability.
	Low resource = 2.5 g, intermediate resource = 20 g, unlimited resource means an individual can collect 50 times its body mass, $b_2 = 0.75, a_2 = 20 a_1$, and $T_e = 15 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$. 
	The lower panels show the influence of temperature when resources are unlimited.
	Low, intermediate, and high temperature = $5, 15, 25 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$.
	We assumed a high active metabolic rate $a_2 = 40 a_1, b_2  = 1.25$.
	Fixed parameter values: $b_1 = 0.75, \rho = 16$.

% E: What happens when b_3 = 1, as in Fig 1?  Would be nice if the values for these two figures matched, though it's good they are at least close.
% T: There are 2 trivial values for b_3 = 0.75 so it matches b_1 and b_3 =1 (linear). I think showing something a bit greater than 0.75 is more informative. I don't want to overcrowd the figures with lines. See the solution I propose with Fig1

	a) Daily net energy gain  $E_n$ as a function of body mass $z$ for different value of foraging exponent $b_3 = 0.5, 0.8, 1.25$, dashed, thin, thick lines respectively  at $T_e  = 15 ^{\circ} \rm{C}$.
	b) $E_n$ is maximized at an intermediate value of $z$  when shaded regions and resource quality $\rho$ intersect (i.e., \cref{eq:C1} is satisfied).
	Warm ($35^{\circ} \rm{C}$) and cold (15$^{\circ} \rm{C}$) environmental temperatures are denoted by red and cyan, respectively.
	The upper (lower) limit of the shaded region is $\widetilde{dE_n}$ ($\widetilde{E_n}$).  
	c) Various shapes of $E_n$ based on b).
	In b) and c), $\rho = 13, 60, 100$ dashed, thin, and thick, respectively.

	Lowest temperature required for the completion of warm-up as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.

	Solar radiation increases linearly from 0 to 0.25 of the maximum value $S_0$ during a period of 6 hours.

	Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 0.05 \, c_p, r_3 = 0.5$.

	Solid (dashed) lines represent abundant (scarce) resource $R = 30, (15)$).
	Reduction in resource availability does not affect the much smaller individual so that solid and dashed lines overlap ($b_3 = b_2 = b_1 = 0.75$).
