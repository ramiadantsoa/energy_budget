    Model components.
    (a) Unidirectional solid lines show one component affecting another.
    Bidirectional dashed lines show a correlation or indirect link between the two components.
    Input variables are denoted by hexagons for intrinsic variables and non-rhomboid parallelograms for environmental variables.
    The main processes are denoted by rounded rectangles (metabolic and foraging rates)  and rhombus (warm-up needs to be completed before foraging).
    (b) Power law functions of body mass, $z$, are used throughout the model for the relationship between body mass and metabolic and foraging rates in (a).
    The expression $z^b$ is concave when $0 < b < 1$ and convex when $b > 1$.

    Scenarios whereby thermal performance does or does not peak at intermediate body mass.
    In each panel, dashed, thin, and thick lines depict different foraging rate exponents ($b_3 = 0.5,\ 0.8,\ \text{and } 1.25$, respectively).
    ``Standard'' extrinsic parameter values are
    resource quantity $R = 500$ (defined only when the resource amount is fixed; panels a,b,e,f),
    resource quality $\rho = 12$,
    foraging time $\tau_f = 45 \text{ min}$ (defined only when foraging time is fixed; panels c,d,g,h),
    and environmental temperature $T_e = 15^\circ C$.
    Intrinsic parameter values for active metabolic rate are $a_2 = 20 a_1 \text{ and } b_2 = 0.75$ for ``standard'' (panels a--d), and $a_2 = 30 a_1 \text{ and } b_2  = 1.25$ for ``higher'' (panels e--h).
    Additional parameter values and measurement units are provided in \cref{table:table1}.

	Warm-up for ectotherms and endotherms.
	a) Lowest temperature that allows the completion of warm-up, as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of six hours to complete warm-up.
    Thick, thin, and dashed lines represent endotherms with laminar convection, ectotherms with laminar convection, and ectotherms with free convection, respectively.
    Solar radiation is 1/4 the value at 30$^\circ$ latitude during equinox, and the convection factor is $K_2 = 0.1$.
    b) Duration of warm-up for endotherms (thick lines) and ectotherms (dashed lines) as a function of body mass and temperature, for free convection.  % E: correct to add "free convection"?
    Solar radiation is halved and $K_2 = 1$.
    For a) and b), wind speed $u = 1$, contraction frequency constant $a_w = 1.25$, and other parameter values and units are in \cref{table:table1}.
	% Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 0.05 \, c_p, r_3 = 0.5$.

    Effect of warm-up on thermal performance for small (thin lines, $z = 0.5$) and large (thick lines, $z = 2$) individuals under free convection.
