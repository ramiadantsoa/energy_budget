	A caricature of how the exponent influences the concavity (convexity)of the power law relationship.
	The black and gray lines represent foraging (gain) and  metabolic rates (cost).
	The coefficient of the metabolic rate is a bit lower to visualize cases where that the gain is more than the cost.

	Lowest temperature required for the completion of warm-up as a function of body mass.
	The individual is given a maximum of 6 hours to complete warm-up.
	The thorax is half of the total body mass.
	To focus on the effect of solar radiation, daily temperature is constant.
	Solar radiation increases linearly from 0 to 0.25 of the maximum value $S_0$ during a period of 6 hours. 
	a) conductance is low (0.1 $\times$ the default value).
	b) conductance is default, wind speed  = 0.1m/s.
	c) For endotherm with free convection $a_w = 1.25$. 
	Fixed parameter values: default conductance $K_1 = 0.05 c_p, r_3 = 0.5$.
	Remaining parameters are in table 1.

	c)  As a function of resource availability. 
	Thick line = high resource (30), thin line = low resource (15).
	Thick and thin gray lines overlap because the small is not affected by resource loss.
