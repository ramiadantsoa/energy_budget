  Abstract                 = {abstract: Bergmann’s rule states that, within species of mammals, individuals tend to be larger in cooler environments. However, the validity of the rule has been debated. We examined the relationship between size and latitude as well as size and temperature within various species of mammals. We also tested the idea that smaller mammals follow Bergmann’s rule more strongly than larger mammals, as expected if heat conservation is the cause of the rule. When all studies were included, the percentage of species showing a positive correlation between size and latitude was significantly >50% (78 of 110 species). Similarly, the percentage of species showing a negative correlation between size and temperature was significantly >50% (48 of 64). Analyses using only significant studies or only studies that sampled extensively also support Bergmann’s rule. The size‐latitude and size‐temperature trends were consistent within all orders and most families for which data are available. We did not find support for the hypothesis that smaller mammals conform more strongly to Bergmann’s rule than larger mammals. Thus, we found broad support for Bergmann’s rule as a general trend for mammals; however, our analyses do not support heat conservation as the explanation.},

  Abstract                 = {Basically all organisms can be classified as determinate growers if their growth stops or almost stops at maturation, or indeterminate growers if growth is still intense after maturation. Adult size for determinate growers is relatively well defined, whereas in indeterminate growers usually two measures are used: size at maturation and asymptotic size. The latter term is in fact not a direct measure but a parameter of a specific growth equation, most often Bertalanffy's growth curve. At a given food level, the growth rate in determinate growers depends under given food level on physiological constraints as well as on investments in repair and other mechanisms that improve future survival. The growth rate in indeterminate growers consists of two phases: juvenile and adult. The mechanisms determining the juvenile growth rate are similar to those in determinate growers, whereas allocation to reproduction (dependent on external mortality rate) seems to be the main factor limiting adult growth. Optimal resource allocation models can explain the temperature-size rule (stating that usually ectotherms grow slower in cold but attain larger size) if the exponents of functions describing the size-dependence of the resource acquisition and metabolic rates change with temperature or mortality increases with temperature. Emerging data support both assumptions. The results obtained with the aid of optimization models represent just a rule and not a law: it is possible to find the ranges of production parameters and mortality rates for which the temperature-size rule does not hold.},

  Abstract                 = {Several of Anisoptera maintain their body temperature more constant than ambient temperature. Species that spend most of their active period on perches (perchers) and make only short flights thermoregulate heliothermically, primarily by means of postural adjustments. Some of the species that fly continuously (fliers) are endothermic regulators during flight. They control body temperature by: (1) controlling metabolic heat production by alternately using gliding or powered flight; (2) controlling heat loss by altering circulation between thorax and abdomen. Small fliers are unable to regulate well because they are subject to high rates of convective heat loss. Cooling constants, as defined by Newton's law of cooling, are related to thoracic weight by a negative power function over a wide size range. Cooling constants are higher in live dragonflies than in dead ones, a difference that is accentuated at high ambient temperatures. High cooling constants at high temperatures probably result from increased rates of circulation. Most fliers, and some large perchers, are able to elevate their body temperature by @'wing-whirring.@' In some species the rate of heat production apparently varies in response to ambient temperature. The body temperature at which flight begins after warm-up is positively correlated with body weight, probably because wing loading increases with increasing body size. The maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature and the threshold of heat torpor of several species were determined. Both parameters are correlated with habitat. The minimum temperature at which flight is possible is positively correlated with body weight and is slightly higher in tropical dragonflies than in temperate zone species. Body temperature is probably more variable relative to air temperature in tropical than in temperate zone species. The ability of dragonflies to maintain a relatively constant body temperature is determined primarily by climate, body size, and behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In recent years, ecologists have stepped up to address the challenges imposed by rapidly changing climates. Some researchers have developed niche-based methods to predict how species will shift their ranges. Such methods have evolved rapidly, resulting in models that incorporate physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Despite their sophistication, these models fail to account for environmental heterogeneity at the scale of an organism. We used an individual-based model to quantify the effects of operative environmental temperatures, as well as their heterogeneity and spatial structure, on the thermoregulation, movement, and energetics of ectotherms. Our simulations showed that the heterogeneity and spatial structure of a thermal landscape are as important as its mean temperature. In fact, temperature and heterogeneity interact to determine organismal performance. Consequently, the popular index of environmental quality (de), which ignores variance and spatial structure, is inherently flawed as a descriptor of the thermal quality of an environment. Future efforts to model species’ distributions should link thermoregulation and activity to environmental heterogeneity at fine scales.},
